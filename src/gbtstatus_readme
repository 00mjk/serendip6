All gbtstatus-related files and functions
=========================================
status_fields:

  * A text file, currently is /src, contains the mysql fields, and their
    respective FITS name in two columns. This is used by s6_observatory_gbt.c
    (to avoid having to recode that every time we change it).

s6_obsaux_gbt.h:
 
  * GBT latitude/longitude defined in here

s6_obsaux_gbt.c:

  * Various functions, largely plucked from setilib, for precessing/deriving 
    RA/Dec from Az/El - used by s6_observatory_gbt.c

s6_observatory_gbt.c:
  
  * How we populate redis database with values obtained from mysql or derived
  * If you change the locale/name of status_fields, edit the appropriate #define
  * All the derived fields are pretty much named in here

s6_obs_data_gbt.h:

  * The omnipresent gbtstatus_t struct is defined in here
 
s6_obs_data_gbt.cpp:

  * How we populate the gbtstatus_t struct from redis database
  
s6_ETFITS_gbt_template.txt:

  * FITS header template

s6_etfits.h:

  * Note the #define for where the s6_ETFITS_gbt_template.txt is located

s6_etfits.cpp:

  * write_integration_header_gbt - output integration header based on gbtstatus
  * write_etfits_gbt - main fits routine, including call to above

s6_output_thread.cpp:

  * updates status shmem with appropriate fields from gbtstatus. NOTE: As of 
    time of writing the field names are different than FITS keys (to make the 
    auto-lexigraphic display more pretty).
